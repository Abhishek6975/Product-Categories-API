# Product-Categories-API

The Product-Categories API is a RESTful web service designed to manage products and their categories. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving products and categories. With this API, you can efficiently organize your products into different categories, making it easy to manage and retrieve them.



## Features

- Product Management: Create, update, delete, and retrieve product information.
- Category Management: Organize products into categories and manage category details.
- Pagination and Sorting: Easily paginate through large sets of products and categories, with sorting options for better organization.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures smooth operation and easy troubleshooting.
- Security:DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes play a crucial role in maintaining security within the Product-Categories API. These classes serve as an intermediary between the client and the API endpoints, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely and only necessary information is transmitted over the network.
